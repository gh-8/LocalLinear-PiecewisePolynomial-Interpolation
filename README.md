Local Linear and Piecewise Polynomial Interpolation Application: Weather Approximation
===============

Objective
----------
Using local linear and piecewise polynomial interpolation to construct and approximate the weather curves.

Algorithm
-----
Using simple linear function approximations and polynomial(increasing degree gradually) to notice and highlight differences in approximations

Results & Observations
-----
After running the MATLAB code, it appeares that piecewise polynomial interpolation (cubic spline) has the second Lowest MSE overall local linear interpolation has the lowest MSE, therefore is the better approximation in this particular instance. 
However, the curve looks much more accurate using the piecewise polynomial interpolation (cubic spline).
